# LangChain Learning with Examples

This repository contains my hands-on learning journey through the LangChain framework using both structured modules and interactive Jupyter notebooks.

I followed various tutorials, documentation, and YouTube walkthroughs to explore how LangChain integrates with modern LLM workflows including tool calling, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), agents, and more.

## 📁 Folder Structure

### 🔹 Module-based Demos (from LangChain repo or self-structured)
- `langchain_models`: Examples of using models via LangChain
- `langchain_prompt`: Prompt templates and chains
- `langchain_structured_output`: Structured outputs from models
- `langchain_chains_main`, `runnables_main`, etc.: Practical use of LangChain chains, runnables, loaders, text splitters, parsers

### 🔸 Jupyter Notebooks
- `agents_in_langchain.ipynb`: Exploring agent architectures and tools
- `langchain_chroma.ipynb`: Using ChromaDB as a vector store
- `langchain_retrievers.ipynb`: Understanding retrievers and retriever chains
- `rag_using_langchain.ipynb`: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation
- `tool_calling_in_langchain.ipynb`: Tool calling with OpenAI-compatible models
- `tools_in_langchain.ipynb`: Miscellaneous tool usage

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Prompt Templates & Chains
- Structured Output & Parsing
- Agents & Tools
- Document Loading, Splitting & Retrieval
- Vector DBs like Chroma
- RAG Pipelines
- Tool Calling APIs

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **LangChain**
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**
- **OpenAI / Google models**
- **ChromaDB**

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo and run any notebook inside a Jupyter environment (e.g., VS Code or Jupyter Lab).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/langchain-learning-with-examples.git
cd langchain-learning-with-examples
jupyter notebook
```

I've learnt LangChain from [CampusX YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@campusx-official) So, the credit goes to this channel and you can also check out their contents
